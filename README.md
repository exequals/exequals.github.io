This the website for Exequals.

Check it out live at <a href="http://exequals.org/">http://exequals.org//</a>!

This website is hosted through <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, more documentation on how they work and how to get setup can be found at the mentioned link.

This website is built with Bootstrap, with some additional CSS for custom styling (static/css/teplate.css). All of the dependencies (images, css, etc.), can be found in the static directory. This is a single page static website, with all the content on index.html, as well as a simple 404 page. (Note about the 404 page : Links in the 404 page are hardcoded, to account for edge cases like http://exequals.github.io/asff/asfsa . Keep that in mind if changing the code). Check the comments in index.html and static/css/template.css for how the page is formatted and sectioned.

See https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll for how to develop locally.
